# Typing game

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

*   **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
*   **CSS:** For styling and basic animations (like word movement).
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** For core game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
*   **JavaScript Particle Library (e.g., [tsParticles](https://particles.js.org/)):** For creating the visual effect when words are correctly typed (dissolving into dots).
